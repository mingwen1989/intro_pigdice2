      <h1>Pig Dice</h1>

      <h2>Player 1 and Player 2 take turns. During their turn, they may roll the die or hold and relinquish the rest of their turn. If a player rolls a 1, their turn is over and their score for that turn is 0. For all other numbers rolled on their turn, those numbers get added to their turn score. The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.</h2>
